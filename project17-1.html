		<p>THIS PROJECT AIMS TO HELP THE RECYCLING INDUSTRIES TO GET PLASTIC RESOURCES <br>THE PROJECT AIMS TO REPLACE PEOPLE IN THE COLLECTION OF PLASTICS
QUESTIONS IS INSTEAD OF USING PEOPLE WHAT CAN WE USE?<br></p><p>ACCORDING TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF WASTE DISPOSAL:
<ul>
<li>	REDUCE</li>
<li>	REUSE</li>
<li>	RECYCLE</li>
</ul></p>
<p>PEOPLE CAN BE EDUCATED ON THE REUSE OF WASTES LIKE THE PLASTIC BOTTLE THAT HAD JUICE CAN BE USED TO STORE VARIOUS THINGS LIKE COOKING OIL AND POWDER SOAP
INSTEAD OF GETTING A SHOPPING BAG EACH TIME YOU GO SHOPPING PEOPLE CAN USE THE BAG THAT THEY BOUGHT THE FIRST TIME THIS CAN HELP TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WASTES<br>THE WASTES CAN BE RECYCLED AGAIN FOR USE ESPECIALLY PLASTIC WASTES. </p>
<p>
 PLASTIC BOTTLES CAN BE COLLECTED AND RETURNED TO THE FACTORY BUT
THE QUESTION IS HOW?<br>
THE FUTURE GENERATION IS GOING TO SUFFER DUE TO PLASTICS AND THE MAJOR WAY TO GET RID OF PLASTICS IS BY PEOPLE TO STOP GETTING INTERESTED ON PLASTIC PACKAGING THIS CAN STOP THE INDUSTIES FROM PRODUCING PLASTIC.
PEOPLE STOP GETTING INTERESTED MEANS TO LIKE FRESH PRODUCTS INSTEAD OF THOSE MANUFACTURED SINCE THEY WILL NEED PLASTIC PACKAGING</p>
<p>IS VERY DANGEROUS TO THE HUMANLIFE AS IT CAUSES VARIOUS DISEASES LKE CANCER AND MICROPLASTICS ARE GETTING SPREAD EVERYWHERE. PLASTIC ARE THE SYNTHETIC MATERIALS MADE OF LONG CHAIN OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN MOLECULES. PLASTICS ARE SO HARMFUL.</p>
<p>SCIENTISTS HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THE CONVERSION OF THE MICROPLASTICS TO FUEL. BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW THEY ARE GOING TO COLLECT THE PLASTICS USING PEOPLE THERE MUST BE THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO HELP IN THE COLLECTION OF PLASTICS. </P>
<p>VISION OF THIS PROJECT IS THE INDUSTRIES TO STOP PRODUCING MORE PLASTICS INSTEAD THE RECYCLING INDUSTIES SHOULD PROVIDE TO THEM PLASTICS THIS CAN HELP TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PLASTICS. BUT WE MUST THINK OF HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP US IN THE COLLECTION OF PLASTICS.</p>

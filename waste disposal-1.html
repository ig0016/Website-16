		<b><p style=font-size:7; id=wastedisposal ><b>Waste Disposal</b> is the process of getting rid of wastes in the environment </p>
		<p style=color:YELLOW>There various ways of waste disposal but basically we have three which are:
		    <font color=YELLOW> <ol>
			<li>Reducing</li>
			<li>
			Reusing</li>
			<li>Recycling</li> 
			</ol></font>
		<p id=reducing ><h4 style=color:YELLOW>Reducing</h4></font>
 <font color=YELLOW size=6><b><p style=text-align:justify;style=color:YELLOW>This is way of minimizing waste materials produced For example we don't have to buy plastic bags each time we go for shoppping we can easily carry a basket.in this way we can protect tha environment this means that if this would be applied by at least 50% of the people in the world if the amount of wastes produced was 500,000kg it means 250,000kg would be prevented from from being produced.</p></b></p>
 </p>  <p id=reusing ><h4>Reusing<h4>
<p style=text-align:justify;>This refers to using an item mor than once .For example an empty magarine can be used to store sugar or salt insteaad of throwing it away which increases amount of wastes on the surface of the earth </p>
<p id=recycling ><h4 style=color:YELLOW>Recycling</h4>
<p style=color:YELLOW>is the changing of products into other forms .For examplebroken glass can be melted and used to make new glass bottles instead of throwing it away to increase amount of wastes</p></p>
<p style=color:YELLOW> other methods of waste disposal are
 <ol>
    <li>Burying<br>This is the process of keeping wastes in the ground. it can be done in two forms which are pitlatrine and tipping and land filling <br>[a]Pit latrine  this is a method used disposing sewage waste. Usually a deep hole is dug and a concreate or wooden platformis covered on top</li>
	<li>Composting<br>is the process of making manure from organic waste such as plants and animal wastes. this process involves digging a hole where organic wastes are kept to form a heap which is watered and turned regulary so as to facilitate its composition to form manure.</li>
	<li>Incineration<br>Is the process of burning wastes until they are completely turnedinto ashes. the instrument used is an incenerator. It is mostly used for disposing hazardous wastes like those produced in health centers</li></ol></p>
	<p id=problem><center> <h2 style=color:YELLOW>Problem Facing waste disposal </h2></center>
	<ol> 
	   <li style=color:YELLOW>Lack of knowledge on effects of poor waste disposal <br>
	   people are not educated on the effects of wastes in the environment and some tend to just ignore the the education provided  and just throw wastes away and some do the waste disposal when they are forced to do so with the authority . this means that if the authority is gone a lot of wastes will be produced </li>
	   <li> Lack of facilities of disposing wastes <br>
	       In developing countries there is lack of machines and facilities which help in  managing wastes are of low technology compared to those used in developed countries </li>
		   <li> Lack of strong enforcement of law by the authorities concerning wastes disposal<br>
		      In some countries there is no much emphasis on environmental conservation especially on waste management (Waste Disposal) this might be due to having a lot of policies to fulfil which they are considered by the government as important for their development hence focus less on the waste management</li>
    </ol></p>			  
	<p id=effectsofpoorwastedisposal><center> <h3>Effects of poor waste disposal</h3></center>
     <p> When wastes are not well handled with care  these are the effects:
         <ol>  
<li>Provide breading place for diseases causing organism eg containers after rain become breeding place like for the mosquitoes </li>
<li>Bad smell due to the decomposition of organic wastes</li>
<li>Cause Epidermic diseases such as cholera and typhoid </li>
<li>Blockage of Drainage system that can cause floods</li> </p> 		 
                    <p id=way>  <center><h3>Ways of reducing wastes </h3></center>
					  <ol>
<li>					  Provision of education to the community about proper ways of waste disposal.<br>
This will help to apply the ways of waste disposal but it is not guaranteed since the education might be provided but the people might not still practise the waste disposal principles

					  <li> Use of plastic that can be recycled or re used and buy products made from recycled materials which may be recycled again after use
<CENTER><IMG SRC=https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.dpH5xTl-Du9VQlVopmkmLQHaE1?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain HEIGHT=400 WIDTH=600></CENTER>					  </li>
					  <li> Buying goods in Bulk</li>
					  This reduces the amount of packaging wastes especially plastic </li>
					  <li>Donate Items <br> Things that are not needed by some one can be donated instead of throwing them away </li>
					  <li>Minimize food waste <br>People should plan meals that match their need instead of cooking excessive foods which they later throw away</li>
					  <li>Applying digital alternatives<br> Instead of using printed hard copies we can use soft copies which help to minimize the wastes </li>
					  </ol></p>
					  <p id=hinder> <u>NOTE</u>: Although ther are way to reduce there are some factors that hinder the application of these ways like <br>
					  <ul>
					       <li>Peoples' attitude,Behavior and concern for the environment </li>
						   <li>Peoples' Lifestylies</li>
						   <li>Negligence</li> </ul><br></p>
